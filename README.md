# OLYMPICS_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS
It is a Data Analysis Project, where I am analyzing the performance of each country, each player on yearly basis.
It is one of the most important project in my Profile as I started my Data Analysis Project work experience with this.
It has taught me basic knowledge like how to firstly find appropriate data for our model, proper tools to extract data from it, various data analysis and visualization tools and create perfect dashboard.
I extracted datasets from Kaggle.
Packages used were streamlit, numpy, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, openpxyl and pyplot.
It is developed on Pycharm code editor and deployed on heroku.
